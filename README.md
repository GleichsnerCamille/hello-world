Camille Gleichsner, but most call me Cami or Cam. I've played guitar for eight years, mostly self taught. I honestly need sleep this is day three of operating on two hours a night. Currently still irked at the bottle of nail varnish saying it was black matte, when it is clearly not. If I wanted to look like a low budget piece of angst I wouldn't have spent over 15 dollars on the varnish. Constantly wondering why gyros with burger meat and/or burgers with gyro toppings aren't a thing yet.
